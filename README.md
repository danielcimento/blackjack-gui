# blackjack-gui

A GUI based adaptation of my final project for McGill's COMP 202 course. The assignment was a course-long production of Card and CardPile code to support basic card games using an object oriented paradigm.

Blackjack was the last assignment, and BlackJackGUI was a personal change done to practice using the JavaFX library. There are still some minor bugs (nothing that affects the gameplay as far as I can tell), and I will work on finishing them if I have time.
